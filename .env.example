# Appwrite Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your actual values

# Appwrite server endpoint (e.g., https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1 or your self-hosted URL)
APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1

# Your Appwrite project ID (found in your Appwrite console)
APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id-here

# Your Appwrite API key (create one in your Appwrite console with appropriate permissions)
# This should be a server-side API key with database read/write permissions

# Instructions:
# 1. Copy this file to .env: cp .env.example .env
# 2. Replace the placeholder values with your actual Appwrite configuration
# 3. Make sure your .env file is in .gitignore (it already is by default)
# 4. For Appwrite Cloud: Use https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1 as the endpoint
# 5. For self-hosted Appwrite: Use your server URL + /v1 (e.g., https://appwrite.yourdomain.com/v1)
